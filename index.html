            Druhin Foundation is to commemorate the life and journey of
DRUHIN SUKLABAIDYA (5 th March 1972 – 17 th August 2021) who
is remembered for his compassion, boundless energy and his
spirit of living in the moment. He may not be known among all
like a celebrity but those who knew him or crossed paths with
him, find it difficult to forget him and, remember him with great
fondness.

He was someone courageous or maybe foolish enough to take the
untrodden path and create his own journey. He was - bundle of
energy, always on some mission; passionate about his causes, be
it politics or work; ethical and principled with his own sets of
ethics which he did not cross no matter what; compassionate
which is a rare quality in present time; hopeful and optimistic
about the future which made him teach and motivate young
people; the one with an endless thirst for knowledge (he was
Google, pre – Google days); a lovable son, motivating and warm
brother, dependable and loyal friend; a generous and lovable
father and a faithful devotee of his guru.

            <strong>Druhin’s</strong> search for himself took him to cross path with Swami Brahma
Vedant Ji in the Osho Anand Ashram Madhavpur, Gujarat. Swami Brahma
Vedant Ji, fondly referred to as Bhagwan by his followers and devotees,
became the anchor that Druhin was looking. He was pulled to his Guru and
the Ashram; and he often travelled to Madhavpur to stay for few weeks or
months. Eventually, life took turn and he shifted permanently to
Madhavpur Anand Ashram in early 2018.
He firmly believed that one does not find a Guru but it is Guru who finds
you. The connection he made with Bhagwan made him shift base to
Madhavpur, work on himself to finally become the best version of himself.
His devotion for Bhagwan and the process of self-evaluation under the
tutelage of his Guru, brought out his naturally compassionate side to the
fore - front along with a passionate desire to walk on the path of dharma.
He was naturally compassionate and now he was finally recognised and
appreciated for this quality. Whereas the path of dharma meant that he also
had to face many cantankerous moments.
His love for Bhagwan, transcended to a wholesome love for the people and
place of his Guru’s abode. He made Anand Ashram at Madhavpur (Ghed) his
home. He turned his home into a safe place where kids would come to run
around, spend time discussing issues that other adults found trivial, be
treated with respect as an individual. The connection made with these kids
encouraged Druhin to start tutoring these kids in his own time. He gave up
his precious morning sleep, learned to cook, and spent all his spare time
teaching these kids. He loved them immensely and was loved back by them
– his demise showed how much of a connect he had with these kids; every
kid has a personal story to share about him. It is therefore, not a wonder
that the Scholarship is only for the students residing in Madhavpur (Ghed),
Gujarat - the place Druhin choose to call home.
An annual Scholarship of Rs. 25,000/- will be on offer as per details below:
1. Annual Scholarship – Scholarship will be annual and based on the
results of the students. Hence the cycle of the Scholarship will be
from July – June.

2. Two Scholarships every year – Scholarships are for the students in
Class XI and XII. One Scholarship of Rs. 25,000/- annually for one
student in class XI and another in Class XII.

3. The Scholarship is restricted to only to the residents of Madhavpur
(Ghed) Gujarat, India.
4. A committee will select the awardees based on the applications
received. The decision of the committee will be final.

Hopefully this scholarship will inspire younger kids to continue with
their education, so as to get the love and blessings of their Druhin
Bhai in the form of this Scholarship.
